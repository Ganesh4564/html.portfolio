<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a graduate student at the University at Buffalo, I have pursued my passion for intelligent systems through a focused academic track in robotics and automation. My journey here has been both challenging and enriching, allowing me to explore advanced topics in control systems, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. With hands-on experience in courses like Robotics I & II and active engagement in projects involving fault detection and real-time control, I have developed a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of robotics engineering.</p>

<p>In parallel with my academic path, I also have a deep-rooted interest in web development. With a background in computer science from my undergraduate studies, I have built and deployed several responsive web applications, incorporating modern frontend frameworks and backend services. I enjoy translating complex ideas into intuitive user experiences and am always keen to explore new technologies in full-stack development. This fusion of robotics and software development has made me a versatile problem-solver with a unique interdisciplinary skill set.</p>

<p>My undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering laid the foundation for my technical career. During that time, I was actively involved in coding clubs, mini-projects, and internships that sharpened my skills in data structures, algorithms, and software architecture. This strong academic base has continued to support my graduate-level pursuits, especially when bridging software with hardware in robotics applications.

Outside of academics, I have always been an active individual with a strong interest in sports. I have played basketball and cricket competitively during both my undergraduate and graduate years. These experiences have instilled in me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and resilience—traits that I carry into my academic and professional life. Whether it's on the court or in the classroom, I approach challenges with energy and a growth mindset.

Overall, my journey as a robotics student, web developer, and athlete reflects a commitment to both intellectual and personal development. I believe in constantly learning, pushing boundaries, and staying grounded—values that continue to shape my academic career and future ambitions in research and innovation.</p>
